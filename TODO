Visualize coverage of all hits across sequence
Normalize bit scores relative to highest score in filtered results, not all results

Ivan's suggestions:
  Show alignment -- simple text is fine
  Show reading frame
  Outboth ID in addition to hit def
  Rewrite mouse handling
    Zoom on both axes
    Zoom more intuitively
    Allow panning
  Allow for displaying bigger SVGs

  Export table format:
    Query ID
    Subject ID
    Bit score
    E value
    Query start/end
    Subject start/end
