Visualize coverage of all hits across sequence
Normalize bit scores relative to highest score in filtered results, not all results

Ivan's suggestions:
  Show alignment -- simple text is fine
  Allow zooming/panning on both axes, rather than just subject axis
  Display blown-up SVG for particular hit of interest

  Export table format:
    Query ID
    Subject ID
    Bit score
    E value
    Query start/end
    Subject start/end
