Normalize bit scores relative to highest score in filtered results, not all results
Include query sequences with no hits in count of hits

Ivan's suggestions:
  Display blown-up SVG for particular hit of interest
  Fix axis labels -- don't necessarily label with "b", given that some sequences may be for AAs

  Allow user to export table with data -- format:
    Query ID
    Subject ID
    Bit score
    E value
    Query start/end
    Subject start/end

Produce error on XML file that's not BLAST XML
Verify that results are valid based on strandedness, etc.
Add loading animation
Display scale demonstrating what gradient means

Add means of setting resolution of PNG export
Support drag/drop file uploads
Make long query/subject names render better

Write bookmarklet to allow direct loading of Kablammo from NCBI BLast
Refactor -- replace jQuery XML parsing with native to speed up this step
Enable pinch-to-zoom on touch devices

----------------------------
Before submitting manuscript
----------------------------
Enable result filtering
  Provide means of filtering by E value
Improve alignment viewing
  Show summation of alignment instead of simple scrollbar, a la Benchling
  Enable exporting the subject or query sequence corresponding to that portion of the alignment
Write help section
  Show how to get BLAST XML file (via NCBI BLAST or CLI) in README and in help section
Fix PNG/SVG export in IE
Have "tour" on homepage
Provide script for augmenting JSON file listing XML
  Be sure to lock file when operating
Visualize coverage of all hits across sequence
  Considering all hits, which parts of query sequence have no hits?
Fix page scrolling to top in Firefox after exporting SVG or PNG
Fix exported SVG rendering improperly in Inkscape
When scale zoomed in, display decimal points on labels -- don't have "39 kb, 39 kb, 39 kb, ..."
Colour edges of each polygon -- white, but with translucency
Change terminology: "subject" -> "hit"
Fix formatting on wide names
Show more interesting results for example results -- e.g., the 494 Kb Haemonchus results
Fix counting of number of hits when filtering
  If multiple hits (e.g., ones from both strands), the number the user enters filters only hits *before* they're split across strands
    Consequence: the user may ask to show only 30 hits per query, but instead sees 58 -- see test case in test-cases directory
  Also, fix sorting -- now, hits to both strands of given subject *always* displayed immediately next to one another, even if hits in one are extremely weeak
    Make clearer when you're displaying reverse complement of given strand -- now, just looks like separate result
Prepend hit name to exported filename so that files will sort in same order as graphs were displayed

Provide means to filter low-quality HSPs -- e.g., I only want HSPs with e value >= whatever
  This was useful in filtering the Haemonchus X chr BAC -- want to get rid of lots of tiny hits, to see only best ones
Implement "choose optimal HSP set" algorithm
For given set of queries/subjects, generate Circos diagram showing HSPs between them
