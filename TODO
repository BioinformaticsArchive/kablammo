Normalize bit scores relative to highest score in filtered results, not all results
Include query sequences with no hits in count of hits

Ivan's suggestions:
  Display blown-up SVG for particular hit of interest
  Fix axis labels -- don't necessarily label with "b", given that some sequences may be for AAs

  Allow user to export table with data -- format:
    Query ID
    Subject ID
    Bit score
    E value
    Query start/end
    Subject start/end

Produce error on XML file that's not BLAST XML
Verify that results are valid based on strandedness, etc.
Add loading animation
Display scale demonstrating what gradient means

Add means of setting resolution of PNG export
Support drag/drop file uploads
Make long query/subject names render better

Write bookmarklet to allow direct loading of Kablammo from NCBI BLast

Fix PNG/SVG export in IE
Have "tour" on homepage
