Visualize coverage of all hits across sequence
  Considering all hits, which parts of query sequence have no hits?
Normalize bit scores relative to highest score in filtered results, not all results
Include query sequences with no hits in count of hits

Ivan's suggestions:
  Display blown-up SVG for particular hit of interest
  Fix axis labels -- don't necessarily label with "b", given that some sequences may be for AAs

  Allow user to export table with data -- format:
    Query ID
    Subject ID
    Bit score
    E value
    Query start/end
    Subject start/end

Produce error on XML file that's not BLAST XML
Provide script for augmenting JSON file listing XML
  Be sure to lock file when operating
Verify that results are valid based on strandedness, etc.
Have "tour" on homepage
Add loading animation
Display scale demonstrating what gradient means

Enable result filtering
Enable alignment viewing
Write help section
  Show how to get BLAST XML file (via NCBI BLAST or CLI) in README and in help section
Add means of setting resolution of PNG export
Fix PNG/SVG export in IE
