Show how to get BLAST XML file (via NCBI BLAST or CLI) in README and in help section
Write help sectoin
Prevent highlighting text in SVG when panning

Visualize coverage of all hits across sequence
Normalize bit scores relative to highest score in filtered results, not all results
Include query sequences with no hits in count of hits
  
Ivan's suggestions:
  Show alignment -- simple text is fine
  Allow zooming/panning on both axes, rather than just subject axis
  Display blown-up SVG for particular hit of interest
  Fix axis labels -- don't necessarily label with "b", given that some sequences may be for AAs

  Export table format:
    Query ID
    Subject ID
    Bit score
    E value
    Query start/end
    Subject start/end
